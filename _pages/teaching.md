### **Undergraduate Courses**

* INDE 4364 Big Data and Analytics, IE, UH, S2019 & S2020.  

Principles, techniques and applications of data analytics, designed mainly for senior undergraduate students who have had a foundation of statistics and computational programming. It primarily focuses on the ideas, algorithms and implementations of data analytics methods for analytic decision-makings in applications. Data analytics methods including regression, classification and clustering will be studied. Programming using R will be taught and data analysis examples in R will be mentioned and demonstrated in Lab sessions.

### **Graduate Courses**

* INDE 7397 Engineering Analytics, IE, UH, F2017, F2018 & F2019.    

A graduate level course focusing on the methods and applications of analytics techniques in machine learning. The course will introduce a variety of analytics techniques including regression, classification, tree-based methods, model assessment and selection, prediction enhancement, system modeling and identification, and high-dimensional statistical modeling. The course will emphasize the theories, ideas, and algorithms behind analytics techniques and demonstrates the methods using real world applications and datasets. Despite that software tools in R will be mentioned and demonstrated along with other materials, this is NOT a software-teaching course. Coding is expected for completion of the project and homework.
